# Random Sprite/Character Generator (Godot C#)
Creates sprites by layering random polygons on top of each other. Can be used for art inspiration or just to look at what RNG can produce.

### NOTE: This is my first time ever posting a public GitHub repo which is kinda scary! Please let me know if I am missing something or need to add additional info.

## Features:
- Tuneable parameters to change how the shapes are arranged.
- Individual "Limb Groups" that allow for customizing polygons on specific parts of the sprite.
- Toggleable x-symmetry on individual groups.
- A (rough) implementation of importing and exporting parameters, allowing for reloading good parameter configurations or sharing them with others.
- A couple of palettes that I lovingly grabbed from Lospec <3.
- Commentated code so you can mostly understand what I'm doing.

## How to edit/compile the code yourself:
You will need the **C#/Mono version of Godot 3.5** in order to edit and compile the program. You'll have to check the Godot website for instructions on how to install the editor and compiler on your system.

## Contributing:
Submit a pull request and I'll check it out. If I think it's a good addition, I'll merge it into the main branch! If you find a bug or have a feature request for the program, you can submit it in the issues page.

## Special Thanks:
Many thanks to Ian Burnette's sprite generator ( https://ianburnette.itch.io/random-sprite-generator ) and old_flick's Sprite Randomizer ( https://old-flick.itch.io/sprite-randomizer ) for serving as inspiration for this project.
